    "The first classifier achieve accuracy rate 83.5%, which is actually worse than the zero model. A zero model always predicts with the majority class, which is 1 in the dataset. Since the overal repaid rate is 85.2%, so the accuracy rate of the zero model is 85.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the accuracy rate is not what we are looking for. The purpose of the classification model is to help us select loans that are more likely to be repaid. So our focus is on the precision rate of class 1. From the classification report of the first model, we can see that the precision rate of class 1 is 0.86, or 86%. This means among all the loans identified as to be fully paid by the classification model, 86% of them are actually fully paid. This is a not much better than the repaid rate of the whole test set, which is about 85%. The reason is that the model only has 0.07 recall rate on class 0, which means, for all loans that are charged off, the model only identifies 7% of them as charged off.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is highly imbalanced, with 85% class 1 and 15% class 0, we can achieve better class 1 precision by setting balanced class_weight. In the second model, we set `class_weight='balanced'`. The default RandomForestClassifier is not very senstive to class_weight change, so we also limit `max_depth` to increase the effectiveness of class_weight change.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the classification report of the second Random Forest Classifier, we can see that even though the accuracy rate drops to 65%, the model has a lot larger class 0 recall at 0.44. It means the model identifies 44% of all charged off loans correctly. More importantly, we get better class 1 precission, 88%, which means, among all loans that are predicted as to be fully paid by the model, 88% of them are actually fully paid.\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing to the portfolio selected by rfc2, in the new portfolio, 36 months loan return drops a bit and 60 months loan return increases a bit. But the biggest impact is that in the new portfolio, there are 10 times more 36 months loans than 60 months loans. While in the dataset, the ratio is about 3 to 1. The reason is that since 36 months loans have much higher repaid rate, when we set class_weight='balanced', the model will bias toward 36 months loans."
