# Data-Analytics---Accounting-Capstone
A data analytics project where I used CRISP-DM framework on the LendingClub dataset.


I applied my data anlytics skills on the provided loans dataset to help investors figure out which loans on the Lending Clubâ„¢ are most profitable.


I have created a classification model to predict whether a loan will be fully paid.

To perform these actions of creating, training and evaluating classification model I am using RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression model in Python.
